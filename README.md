## Walden's AI Language Trainer

Hey, I'm Walden and this is my AI language trainer.

In an attempt to leverage LLM technology for listening practice, I created several tools to help practice language comprehension. 

### Features

    -   Bring your own API key with Google or Open AI, or run your model locally with Ollama.

-   Practice listening to numbers and dates in context, with generated sentences including those numbers


### Techincal Features

### Notes on Language Learning

> [!WARNING] 
> **I'm making no argument with this project that this is "useful" to learn languages.** As someone who is at a high level in Japanese, I wanted to create a tool to specifically help me practice listening to numbers and dates which I was having trouble hearing at full speed when I was having conversations. I think there's a lot of potential in AI creating tailor made language learning content, but this project has made me realize that doing so is quite difficult. I primarly optimized this project for my level of ability in Japanese, which is quite high.
