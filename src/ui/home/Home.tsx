            <p>Before you get started, here are a few notes on using this app.</p>

            <p>These language learning trainers are designed for practicing specific functions of the language. </p>

                In terms of AI grading of responses, my hope is that the AI will be able to point out to you something
                that you may be missing. However, it's important to use your best judgment in interperating the AI's
                response. This is why there is no tracking of stats built into the app. For Number & Date Trainer
                without Sentence Mode enabled there is no LLM interaction whatsoever, so you can rely on those results.
